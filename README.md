# MISFIT THEATER OFFICIAL SITE

About the Company:
Misfit Theatre is a brand new company rising from an entrepreneurship program called the IDEA Centre. We produce meaningful entertainment in a field where that focus has been overlooked. What we bring to the table is bold content with a focus on relevant topics in society. Misfit Theatre embraces new talent, and is determined to improve Saint John’s entertainment experience. We are very excited to announce that auditions for our first show will be held on December 13th and 16th. More information can be found on this site.
